### What is Gringoots App?

Gringotts Bank is an application developed during my internship at Kinetic Software by a team of four people. It is designed for bank employees with a fantasy theme.

From the outset, we researched vendors for deployments. We used Jira to track our progress, breaking down the stages of the process into Epics -> User Stories -> Tasks.

The application has two types of users with access to different functions. We prioritized security, implementing secure routing, password hashing, and authorization tokens, among other measures.
